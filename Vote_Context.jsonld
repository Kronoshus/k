    "comment": "Reducing the treasury cut from 20% to 10% directly benefits Cardanoâ€™s staking ecosystem by increasing staking rewards by approximately 12.5%. This increase enhances the attractiveness of staking and actually makes staking a worthwhile economic model for small projects trying to get off the ground in Cardano. This in turn could help many projects struggling right now sustain themselves.\n\nOne of the biggest flaws with Catalyst right now is projects have to continually propose stuff to get money from them to sustain their businesses. We need an alternative to Catalyst and this proposal is a first step towards doing such a thing. The \"Send to the treasury, withdraw from Catalyst lottery\" does not work and is not good for long term sustainability.\n\nI believe the proposal is constitutional and in line with the spirit of decentralization. I also will vote yes to this proposal in protest against the arbitrary requirements set forth in the Cardano Constitution."
